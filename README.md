DBN-Kyoto (Deep Belief Network for Drug Discovery)
==================================================

This is a drug discovery workload using Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) model.
This algorithm is used to predict if the chemical structure of a compound can interact with the protein sequence.
Deep Learning resolve the bottleneck of exponential increase in the calculation time and memory consumption encountered in SVM algorithm.

These scripts were used for the optimization of [Theano by Intel](https://github.com/intel/theano),
and now this optimization were merged in [Theano](https://github.com/theano/theano).

The results using this implementation were reported in the paper [_CGBVS-DNN: Prediction of Compound-protein Interactions Based on Deep Learning_, MolInf. 2016.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/minf.201600045/abstract), though the first and third authors have no contributions on this study:wink:.
